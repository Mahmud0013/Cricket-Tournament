This project was built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with dynamic data handling in the front end (using arrays/localStorage) and supports future integration with a backend SQL database.

If you want, I can also make a **shorter, more visual version** of this README with emojis and badges so it stands out on your GitHub profile. That style works especially well for showcasing personal projects. Would you like me to make that version too?
